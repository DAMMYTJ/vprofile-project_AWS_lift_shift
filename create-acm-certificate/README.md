For anyone setting up a secure, scalable web application, configuring SSL/TLS certificates is a critical step. Here's how I managed this crucial task using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for my domain, ensuring encrypted traffic between the users and the application. 

### Step 2: Creating a Certificate for Your Domain Using ACM

**AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** simplifies the management of SSL/TLS certificates. Here's how I proceeded to create and validate a certificate for my domain:

#### Certificate Request

First, I decided to request a public certificate, which is suitable for most web applications accessible over the Internet.

| Certificate Type             |
| ---------------------------- |
| Request a public certificate |

#### Domain Details

Next, I entered my domain details. Since I wanted the certificate to be applicable to all subdomains under my main domain, I used a wildcard notation (`*.<your-domain-name>`). Here's the information I provided:

| Domain Names           | Select Validation Method     | Tag Key | Tag Value            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `*.<your-domain-name>` | DNS validation - recommended | Name    | `<your-domain-name>` |

#### DNS Validation

AWS ACM offers DNS validation, which I find more convenient for long-term management compared to email validation. For DNS validation, ACM requires you to add a CNAME record to your DNS configuration. This process proves domain ownership and automates certificate renewal.

After initiating the certificate request, I navigated to the certificate details page in ACM to retrieve the `CNAME name` and `CNAME value`. Then, I logged into my DNS provider's management console to create a new CNAME record with these details:

| Type  | Name               | Data                | TTL    |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------ |
| CNAME | `CNAME name` value | `CNAME value` value | 1 Hour |

**Note:** The TTL (Time To Live) is set to 1 hour by default, which is typically fine, but you can adjust it based on your DNS provider's recommendations or your preferences.

After adding the CNAME record, it usually takes some time for the DNS changes to propagate and for ACM to validate the domain ownership. Once validated, the certificate's status in ACM will change to "Issued," and it's ready to be used with AWS services like Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or CloudFront for secure HTTPS access to your applications.

This setup ensures that all traffic between my users and the application is encrypted, safeguarding data integrity and privacy. Plus, using ACM keeps the certificate management process straightforward, with automatic renewals and no need to manually handle certificate files.
